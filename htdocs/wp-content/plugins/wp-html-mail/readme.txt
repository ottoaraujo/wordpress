== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I send my newsletter campaigns with this plugin? =

No, this is not a newsletter tool, it just makes your emails beautiful but doesn't send custom ones.


= How can I remove the gap at the header of my Contact Form 7 emails? =

Go to your Contact Form 7 email settings and change email type from HTML to text. WP HTML Mail will take care of the HTML.


= Can a customize the HTML code of the email header? =

There's a filter to change the header HTML code. Just add this to your (child-)themes functions.php:

`
add_filter('haet_mail_header', function( $header ){
    return 'hello <strong>world</strong>';
});
`

Of course you can display HTML code, not just text.


= Can a customize the HTML code of the email footer? =

There's a filter to change the footer HTML code. Just add this to your (child-)themes functions.php:

`
add_filter('haet_mail_footer', function( $header ){
    return 'hello <strong>world</strong>';
});
`

= Can I add ustom CSS code to my WordPress emails? =

You can add your own CSS code for desktop and mobile. Just add this example to your (child-)themes functions.php and customize it:

`
add_filter( 'haet_mail_css_desktop', function( $css ){
    $css .= '  
            h1{
                border-bottom: 2px solid green;
            }
        ';
    return $css;
});

add_filter( 'haet_mail_css_mobile', function( $css ){
    $css .= '  
            h1{
                background:red;
            }
        ';
    return $css;
});
`

= How to disable the template for some emails? =

Find anything all emails hav in common. It may be the sender, a word in the subject or something in the email body.
Then add this function to your (child-)themes functions.php and customize it. Return TRUE if the template should be used and FALSE if not.

`
// return true if you want to use a template for current mail
// return false if you want to leave the content of this email unchanged
add_filter( 'haet_mail_use_template', 'customize_template_usage', 10, 2 );
function customize_template_usage( $use_template, $mail ){
    // $mail['to'] ...
    // $mail['subject'] ...
    // $mail['message'] ...
    // $mail['headers'] ...
    // $mail['attachments'] ...
    return true;
}
`
